                    Abstract: In this welcome talk, I will provide a brief history of Mayo Clinic and highlight integrated medicine, informatics, and selected innovations. We will describe the critical roles played by IT, engineering, data science, informatics, and AI in the care of the tomorrow envisioned by Mayo Clinic's 2030 Cure Connect Transform strategy. I will summarize the opportunities and challenges faced in our mission which will require strong partnership from the technology and engineering communities.

                <b>Abstract:</b> Robust clinical evidence is the foundation to evidence-based medicine (EBM). However, our clinical research enterprise faces multiple challenges and the PubMed evidence base is fraught with free-text evidence of mixed quality, preventing evidence adoption among clinicians and reducing the trust in science among patients. In this talk I will provide a high-level overview of my lab's  research on developing informatics and data science methods to improve the impact of clinical evidence resulting from clinical trial research, spanning the continuum from evidence generation to evidence dissemination. I will cover issues such as informatics-based diversity optimization for clinical research enrollment, data-driven eligibility criteria optimization, scalable clinical evidence extraction and representation, and automated conflicting evidence detection for published clinical trial studies. I will conclude with research opportunities to developing informatics and data science methods to improve the robustness and computability of clinical evidence.

                <b>Abstract:</b> Health literacy is a widely recognized challenge for public health, with many adults lacking the requisite skills to engage successfully in the management of their health and healthcare. Affecting both individual and societal health outcomes, it particularly exacerbates the increasing physical and psychological burden for patients with multiple health conditions as well as the elderly and disadvantaged populations. Recent developments in digital therapeutic solutions offer an opportunity to apply systems thinking and perspectives to synthesize the myriad components of a multi-pronged approach to improving societal health literacy at scale. This talk will highlight some of these developments with a focus on digital platforms and algorithmic artifacts in the healthcare delivery setting, recognizing the challenges of misinformation and disinformation in identifying and disseminating authoritative and accurate content for educating and empowering patients and the public.
