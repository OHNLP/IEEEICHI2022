                        This CME opportunity is one of our efforts in building the healthcare workforce for the care of the tomorrow, transformed by digital innovations. ICHI, hosted by Institute for Healthcare Informatics, is the premier community forum concerned with the application of computer science, information science, data science, and informatics principles, as well as information technology, and communication science and technology in healthcare, medicine, life science, public health, and everyday wellness. ICHI 2022 will deliver content to address the knowledge and awareness gaps around data science, informatics, and AI for healthcare as well as the deployment of innovation solutions into practice. It will allow providers to interact with and learn from other providers, data scientists, clinical informaticists and other experts about digital transformation in healthcare.
